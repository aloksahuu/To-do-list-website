# To-do-list-website
 
 I have created a user-friendly to-do list website where users can add, edit, and delete tasks. Additionally, implement local storage to save tasks, so they persist even after a page refresh. Here are the project details:

Project Details:
1. Functionality: Users can do :-
   - Add new tasks.
   - Edit existing tasks.
   - Delete tasks.
   - Mark tasks as completed or uncompleted.
2. Local Storage: Tasks should be stored locally so that they are retained even if the user closes the browser.
3. User Interface: Focus on improving the user interface for a seamless and intuitive user experience.
